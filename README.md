# TestCoordinators

## Notes

Proof of concept of Coordinator pattern ([[1]](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/), [[2]](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/), [[3]](https://davedelong.com/blog/tags/a-better-mvc/)) usage with `UINavigationController` and iOS 13 interactive modal transition.

Before adopting Coordinator pattern consider another approach of using `UIViewController` as if it was a coordinator [https://github.com/insidegui/mvcwithsugar](https://github.com/insidegui/mvcwithsugar).
